Minimum Diff

Implement a function that takes in two non-empty arrays of int, finds the pair of numbers (one from each arr) who absolute difference is closed to zero, and returns a pair containing these two numbers, with the first number from array.
Only one such pair will exist for the test.

Input:
Arr1 = [23, 5, 10, 17, 30]
Arr2 = [26, 134, 135, 14, 19]

Output:
17, 19
